#So when to use list and when to use a dictionary?

#If you want to group data of the same kind, you'd use a list. Example: a list of European cities:

eu_cities = ["Vienna", "Malaga", "Budapest", "Cologne", "Zagreb"]

# But if you'd like to group data of different kinds, you'd use a dictionary:

jordan = {"first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Jordan", "age": 56, "games_played": 1072, "total_points": 32292}
